        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our Website Project!</p>
        <p>In a limited timeframe our team had a great journey starting with the completion of
            3 courses for enhancing our capacity of markup languages - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            Now, it is time demonstrate our newfound knowledge, as we collaborate to create a collective 
            website project. This project is not only the indication of individual skills, but also a 
            product of our teamwork and development.

    <h1 id="overvtitle">Overview of The Project</h1>
    <div class="overv" id="overview">
        <div id="overv_txt">
            <p>Our project is a culmination of expertise gained through the courses in HTML, 
                CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal was not only to master these markup languages 
                individually but to seamlessly integrate them in a collaborative effort. In this section, 
                we offer a brief explanation of the key components learned throughout the courses and the 
                objectives that define our project.<br><br>
                - The journey began with a comprehensive understanding of HTML, the backbone of web development, 
                laying the groundwork for structuring content.<br><br>
                - Building upon HTML, we delved into the world of CSS to enhance the
                visual appeal of our web pages, mastering techniques for layout, design, and so on.
                <br><br>
                - As a bonus part, the JavaScript course covered the fundamental programming concepts.<br><br>
                In addition to these courses, thanks to the project we got familiar with Git and Github Desktop 
                and managed the coordination of the work successfully. As a result, we again understood the 
                importance of well-prepared organization of the project and teamwork in a real-world scenario.

        <h1>Team members</h1>
        <p>First of the dedicated pages introduce each team member, providing short information about them.
            As a part of our project, in another page we share the highlights from the 
         <a href="https://hourofcode.com/az/en" target="_blank">Hour of Code</a> event.<br><br> 
         Regarding the preparation, first, we got together in a GitHub repository and decided about every 
         member's duties. Working on this platform enabled us to view the progress of our project regularly. 
         During the process, we had some difficulties in certain points such as design, layout, and content, but 
         managed to fix all of them in a collaborative way. The structure of the pages and some other necessary 
         features are discussed together, then we applied all the decided ones to our work.<br>

            To conclude, this project taught us a number of useful concepts and we are looking forward to work 
            together for the upcoming projects.
